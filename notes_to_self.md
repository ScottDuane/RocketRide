Day 1 notes:

- Had trouble in the RocketsIndex render method with properly rendering the rockets.
- Tomorrow, add RocketsIndexItem to make this easier
- Not sure if the redirect to www.rocketride.space is working yet.  Check again tomorrow.  

Day 2 notes:

- rocketride.space is still not properly redirecting to Heroku app, but it doesn't yield the namecheap redirect.  
Look into this tomorrow.
- Routes for show pages are broken, although the links do appear on the RocketIndex.  
- image_url attribute is not defaulting properly, and is not being read in with the seed data. Wtf.  
- How to get images into the RocketForm?  Not sure on this.  Seems hard.
- HISTORIESSSS make no sense.  
- Navbar appears but looks bad, and is not above the h2.  

Day 3 notes:

- Next step is to start reservation components.  List of current user's reservations (ReservationIndex),
ReservationForm on each rocket's show page.
- Still no styling on Navbar.  Address this tomorrow and ask about adding filters.  Maybe a filter component?  

Day 5 notes:

- BUG: checkboxes on filter form not working
- FEATURE: update rocket form not implemented
- BUG: captain's name not appearing
-
