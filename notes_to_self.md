Day 1 notes:

- Had trouble in the RocketsIndex render method with properly rendering the rockets.
- Tomorrow, add RocketsIndexItem to make this easier
- Not sure if the redirect to www.rocketride.space is working yet.  Check again tomorrow.  

Day 2 notes:

- rocketride.space is still not properly redirecting to Heroku app, but it doesn't yield the namecheap redirect.  
Look into this tomorrow.
- Routes for show pages are broken, although the links do appear on the RocketIndex.  
- image_url attribute is not defaulting properly, and is not being read in with the seed data. Wtf.  
- How to get images into the RocketForm?  Not sure on this.  Seems hard.
- HISTORIESSSS make no sense.  
- Navbar appears but looks bad, and is not above the h2.
